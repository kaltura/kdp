Following is a summary of the expressions the KDP can evaluate.

1. The KDP evaluates expressions in four cases:

	1. A layout component is set with an expression
		e.g. setting a label to show the current entry name
		 	<Label text="{mediaProxy.entry.name}" />
	
	2. A layout component fires a command
		e.g. clicking on a button should navigate to a url
			<Button kClick="navigate(http://www.kaltura.com)" />
	
	3. An external script calls the evaluate function
		e.g. retrieve the current entry name 
	
		kdp.evaluate("{mediaProxy.entry.name}")

	4. An external script calls the setAttribute function
		e.g. setting a lebel with the id topLabel to show the current entry name 
		kdp.setAttribute("topLabel", "text", "{mediaProxy.entry.name}")
	
2. Expression types

	1. Simple expression
		A simple expression is a constant quoted string such as "My video player".
		
	2. Binding expression
		A binding expression is re-evaluted everytime a part of the expression changes.
		The binding parts of the expression are sorrounded by curly brackets.
		
		e.g. setting a label to show the current entry name
		 	<Label text="{mediaProxy.entry.name}" />
		 	
		An expression can include both constant and binding parts:
		 
	 	<Label text="Name: {mediaProxy.entry.name} - {mediaProxy.entry.duration}" />
	 	
	 	Note: when evaluating a binding expression for firing a command or when it is requesed via the evaluate
	 	external interface function the values are not binded but just evaluted at the time of the call. 
	 	
3. Scope
	When an expression is used within an item renderer such as a playlist item the this keyword should be
	used in order to instruct the KDP to retrieve the attribute of the curernt data provider.
	
	e.g. showing the name and thumbnail of a playlist item:
	 	<Label text="{this.name}" />
		<Image url="{this.thumbnailUrl}" />
		
4. Using functions
	Expressions may include calling to an internal KDP function.
	
	e.g. formatting a the date of a playlist item
		<Label text="{formatDate(this.duration, 'NN:SS')}" />
		
	or navigating to a given url
		<Button kClick="navigate(http://www.kaltura.com)" />
		
	The functions are action script functions written under the FuncsProxy class.
	A function can be written specifically under a data provider by specfiying an _owner property
	under the data provider that will point to an object containing the function. 

5. Available functions
	The following functions are available through FuncsProxy
	
	1.	formatDate(dateObject:*, format:String):String
		Format a date using a format string
		//todo - list available format dates
		
		e.g. <Label text="{formatDate(this.duration, 'NN:SS')}" />
		
	2.	navigate(url:String, window:String = null):void
		Request the browser to navigate to a url with a specified window
		
		e.g. <Button kClick="navigate(http://www.kaltura.com)" />
		
	3.	not
		This function reverse a boolean value, or a string value with casting to boolean. 
		param obj - the object to reverse
		param defaultValue - the default in case a string is received and it is not 'true' and not 'false'
		
		e.g. <button id="myButton" visible="{not(video.player.playing)}" />
		this example will hide the button whenever the video is playing, and show it when it is not playing
		
	4.	jsCall(...args):void
		Call a javascript function
		
		e.g. <Button kClick="jsCall('alert', mediaProxy.entry.name)" />
		
		Javascript functions can be defined within the layout configuration xml under the "javaScript" node.
		Each function is declared as an xml node with the id of the defined function.
		The contents of the node is a CDATA section with the javascript code.
		When the function is called the code within the CDATA section is concatenated with the call request
		and evaluated using the eval javascript function 
		   
		<javaScript>
  	 		<jsBlock id="returnDom">
  	 			function returnDom(){ return document.domain }
  			 </jsBlock>
  		</javaScript>
