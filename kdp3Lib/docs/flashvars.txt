	widgetId
		Widget id on the kaltura system
	
	uiConfId
		UI configuration id of the current player (defaults to the uiConfId assigned to the widget)


Media selection
---------------

	sourceType = entryId [entryId,url]
		Media source type to be played which can be either a Kaltura EntryId or URL
	
	entryId
		The actual default media to be played - either a kaltura EntryId or a URL
		
	referenceId
		Reference Id of an entry to be played (instead of entryId). the player gets  
		a list of entries with matching referenceId and plays the first in the list. 	

Media delivery
--------------

	streamerType = http [http,rtmp,live,auto]
		Defines the delivery method of the content, either http, rtmp or live
	
	streamerUrl = 
		The FMS application url (e.g. rtmp://rtmpakmi.kaltura.com/ondemand)
		
	streamFormat = [undefined,mp4]
		For mp4 streams the FMS requires the stream name to be prefixed with mp4:  
	
	streamUrlTemplate
		Allows the building of a formatted url to access the actual media. The string may include several placeholders:
		
		{entryId} - the entryId
		{flavorId} - the flavorId
		
		The placeholders are replaced with the actual values.
		
		e.g.: /ns/sample/{entryId}_{flavorId} 
		

	rtmpFlavors = [undefined,1]
		Instructs KDP to use adaptive bitrate dynamic streaming and use available media flavors 
		
	mediaProtocol = [rtmpt] (effective since KDP 3.4.6)
		Flashvar dtermining the protocol from which the KDP media is loaded. If no value is passed, assumes the value of the streamerType.

		When set to true, media will be reloaded when resuming live stream. (Was added to support Wowza pause/play live stream).
		
	ignoreStreamerTypeForSeek = [true/false]
		when set to true, the KDP will call OSMF player.seek, even when in http and appear to be intelliseek
		
	twoPhaseManifest = [true/false]

	flavorTags = [string]
		when this flashvar is set, KDP will add "tags" parameter to playmanifest call. PlayManifest will return only flavors tagged with the provided string. Currently only a signel flavo is supported.
		              
Miscellaneous
-------------

	kml = [undefined,local,inject]
		Defines how to load the configuration xml.
		undefined - By default the configuration is loaded from	Kaltura servers via the uiConf object.
		local - load 'config.xml' from local file system
		inject - used by AppStudio to preview the KDP by injecting an xml via the init( xml : XML ) function
		
	kmlPath = config.xml
		When the kml variable is set to local, this is the path from which the configuration xml will be loaded
		
	httpProtocol = [http,https]

		tag of the page:
		 			//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					// Privates
					 var jsReady = false;
					//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

						return jsReady;
					}
		in the <body> tag, set the onload property to "onInit()". This is in accordance with Adobe's best practice for integrating 
		Flash/Flex applications in html pages:
		http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=19_External_Interface_09.html
		
	jsCallbackReadyFunc = null [string]
		The jsCallbackReady func specifies the name of the js function to call when the kdp indicates to the js interface that it is loaded and ready

Components & Plug-ins attributes
--------------------------------

Every component attribute can be overriden using flashvars.
For example, in order to make the playlist load automaticlly the following variable should be set:
	General case: {The id of the playlistAPI in the configuration xml}.{Attribute name} = {value}
	Sample: playlistAPI.autoPlay=true (where playlistAPI is the id of the plugin in the configuration xml)

Another example is changing the skin path url:
	{Layout tag id}.skinPath
	full.skinPath=blablabla/bla.swf

Loading of plugins can be done in a similar way: 
	{Plugin name}.plugin = true - Triggers the loading of the plugin. This will be the id of the plugin if and id wont be specified
	{Plugin name}.path = path - The path from where to load the plugin, if not given the plugin will be loaded from Kaltura's plugin path
	{Plugin name}.relativeTo = id - Component id within the layout to position relative to
	{Plugin name}.position = [before,after,firstChild,lastChild] - position relative to given component id 
	{Plugin name}.pluginName = class name - in case the same plugin swf contains multiple plugins
	{Plugin name}.asyncInit = ["true"/"false"] - in case the initializePlugin function of the plugin calls an INTEGRAL a-sync load which completes the init process.
	{Plugin name}.loadingPolicy = {[wait,onDemand,noWait,preInitialize]} - instruct when to load the plugin.
									wait - Do not enable GUI until the plugin is loaded.
									onDemand - plugin must only be loaded if a specific component in the KDP demands it.
									noWait- plugin is loaded in a non-synchronized way, the GUI becomes enabled even if the plugin has not yet loaded.
									preInitialize - plugin is loaded before GUI is created.
	{Plugin name}.asyncInit = [true/false] - flag indicating whether the plugin initialization process involves a-synchronous processes. If == true -> the plugin is required to report
											that its initialization is complete (or failed) by firing the KPluginEvent.ASYNC_INIT_COMPLETE (KPluginEvent.ASYNC_INIT_FAILED).
	{Plugin name}.{any additional attribute} = {value} - setting any additional attribute specific to the plugin

Built-in components (non plugins) can be loaded as well using flashvars the same way plugins are loaded with the following addition:
{name of the component}.className = Button


MediaProxy variables
--------------------
 
	mediaProxy.selectedFlavorId
		the currently selected flavor
		
	mediaProxy.preferedFlavorBR
		a prefered bitrate for selecting the flavor to be played. in case of an rtmp adaptive mbr a -1 value

		When the media is Image and played in a playlist we will set the defualt 
		time of the image to the next value unless override from flashvars
		
	mediaProxy.supportImageDuration [true,false]
		Some types of media need to behave defrently in a listed ui (playlist,related list) like
		Image that need to play with duration if a list is loaded it need to set this attribute to true
		if you want to play image in a non listed way even if you load a list set this flag to false again
		
	mediaProxy.initialBufferTime = 2
		set initial buffer time for quick starting the playing of a stream
					
	mediaProxy.expandedBufferTime = 10
		set the maximum buffer time to be set once the video started playing in order to minimize further buffering events
	
	mediaProxy.expandedLiveBufferTime = 0.75
		sets the maximum buffer time to be set for a live entry - once the video has started playing and we want to minimize further buffering events.
	
	mediaProxy.initialLiveBufferTime = 0.75
		sets the initial buffer time for a live entry in order to start the playback quickly.
		
	mediaProxy.entryMetadata
		Retrieve the object on the MediaVO class which contains the custom entry metadata information.
	
	mediaProxy.entryCuePoints
		Retrieve the object on the MediaVO class which contains the cue point information related to the current entry.
	
	mediaProxy.mediaPlayFrom = 20
		Set the video start-time to be something other than 0.
	
	mediaProxy.mediaPlayTo = 45
		Setting this parameter indicates to the player to pause the main content at the indicated time.
